// main.cpp //
The main function is used for testing for different clusters. Main function includes Point.h and Cluster.h file. Main function displays the Hello world and it displays different clusters.

// Point.h //
This is the header file for point class. I defined the class point inside the namespace Clustering. In the point class has private members dim and values. And in the public has constructors and destructors. Accessors and mutators are declared inside the class. The function distanceTo and overloaded operaters are declared in this class. Overloaded operators do the addition, subtractions, division, and  multiplications. I created 12 friend members.

// Point.cpp //
Implementation file for Point.cpp is not clear because I expend a lot of time and I tried many different ways and I decided to submit this code.  I used vector for this file. All work done inside class Point. I have done all algorithms for distnaceTo function and all addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. All overloading algorithms are done here. 

// Cluster.h //
Cluster.h is header file for cluster.cpp and all work done inside the namespace Clustering. I created struct and typedef type outside the class cluster. I created cluster constructors and destructors and friend overloading operators.  I created addition, subtractions, multiplication, and division. 

// Cluster.cpp //
In this file all work done inside the cluster class. I have done some algorithms in this file. I have done here only addition, subtraction, comparison overloading. I used vector in this file. 

In the overall, all files are run fine except Point.cpp. I got problems with Point.cpp. other all working fine.
